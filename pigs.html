<h1>Duroc</h1><br><br>
	<center>
	  <img src="images/duroc-pig.jpg" width="640" height="299" alt=""/>
	</center><br><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duroc breed of pigs is famous for its auburn color, fast growth and maturity, and quiet temperament.

Durocs are also famous for their deep bodies, high carcass quality, and broad hams and shoulders.

The British developed the Duroc breed of pigs to survive winter, making it your best choice for outdoor breeding.</p><br><br>
	<h4>DUROC PIG HISTORY AND ORIGIN</h4>
A lot of pig breeds originate from the United Kingdom, but Duroc pigs actually originated in the United States.

While the characteristically red color was solidified around 1800 in New England, there is still a lot of speculation as to how the color came to be.

It might be that the Duroc pig had ancestors from West Africa, or it could be a long-distance relative of the Berkshire pig which was once reddish brown.

Another theory even suggests Duroc pigs owe their heritage to Spain and Portugal.<br>

	<h4>CROSSBREEDS</h4>
The National Swine Registry explains that the Duroc pigs common today were crossbred in Saratoga County, New York between two distinct breeds: Jersey Reds and Old Durocs.

In fact, you may also see these pigs called Duroc-Jersey, which is a reference to their crossbreeding past.<br>
	<h4>SIZE</h4>
Duroc pigs are classified as medium-sized pigs, although they tend to be at the high end of this category.<br>

	<h4>WEIGHT</h4>
You can expect male Durocs, or boars, to be 800 pounds and female Durocs, or sows, to be 700 pounds.

This might seem like a lot, but before the final breed was established, Duroc pigs could regularly top 1,000 pounds.

Their large weight is one of the reasons they are so popularly bred for their meat.<br>

	<h4>COLOUR</h4>
Duroc pigs really stand out, thanks to their dark red color.<br><br>
<h2>Hampshir</h2>
	<center>
	  <img src="images/hampshire-pig.jpg" width="640" height="299" alt=""/>
	</center><br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Bred initially from British stocks in Wessex, farmers in the United States now produce the Hampshire pig as one of the world’s most essential swine breeds.

If you breed the Hampshire, you can rest assured that you will not run out of tips and tricks for successful breeding.

We also call the Hampshire pig “the thin rind” because it produces an abundance of lean meat.

Hampshire pig carcasses are known for winning many lean-meat carcass competitions in North America.</p><br>
	<h4>SIZE</h4>
While they might seem large to the average person, Hampshire pigs are actually classified as a medium-sized breed.<br>
	<h4>WEIGHT</h4>
Hampshire pigs can become quite large. Boars can top the scales at 650 pounds while sows can get up to 550 pounds.<br>
	<h4>COLOR</h4>
Hampshire pigs have very distinct coloring. While their bodies are almost all black, a white belt exists around their middle that covers their front legs and down to their hooves.  

If you see a Hampshire pig that is white or ginger in color, it often means it has been crossbred.<br>

	<h4>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h4>
One very unique characteristic of this breed is their erect ears. While other pigs have floppier ears, Hampshire pigs have black ears that stick straight up.

While Hampshire pigs have medium-sized heads, their eyes are quite small. As a result, their vision can be quite limited.

As for tails, expect short, curly tails with Hampshire pigs.<br><br>
<h2>YORKSHIRE</h2><br><br>
	<center>
	  <img src="images/yorkshire-pig.jpg" width="640" height="299" alt=""/>
	</center><br><br>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yorkshire pigs are distinguishable by their white color and erect ears.

Aside from being sound and durable, the modern Yorkshire pig produces very lean meat with low back fat.

Upon introducing the Yorkshire pig to the United States, farmers discovered ways to improve its mothering ability, litter size, and scale.

This improvement increased the demand and domestication of Yorkshire pigs in the USThey need a bit more space than other types of pigs, but their positive attributes make them a natural choice for most farmers. Sows produce large litters and have excellent mothering instincts.

Once fully matured, Yorkshire pigs are slaughtered for their back bacon and lean cuts of meat..</p><br>
	<h4>SIZE</h4>
Yorkshire pigs are classified as medium-sized pigs. However, they have rather long bodies and solid legs and feet.

Their proportionate size allows the Yorkshire breed to be quite active and healthy.

They need plenty of room to run around and receive adequate exercise.

	<h4>WEIGHT</h4>
Male Yorkshire pigs can weigh between 550 and 750 pounds. Female pigs can weigh between 450 to 650 pounds.
	<h4>COLOR</h4>
When you think of pigs, you often think of cute animals that are pink in color.

Well, Yorkshire pigs may be a bit bigger than this image, but they sure fit the description.

Yorkshires are light pink in color, making them almost seem like a white pig from the distance.

Their faces are slightly indented and they have erect ears. Furthermore, their tails curl slightly, giving this breed of swine an almost whimsical look.

	<h4>BEHAVIOR</h4>
Yorkshire pigs are large, but they are also long which means they are actually quite agile. They need a fair bit of space to be housed.

While you can raise Yorkshire pigs on a hobby farm, make sure you have adequate space for them.<br><br>
<h2>LANDRACE</h2><br><br>
	<center>
	  <img src="images/landrace-pig.jpg" width="640" height="299" alt=""/>
	</center><br><br>
	<p>American landrace pigs are also white like the Yorkshire pigs, but their ears droop and slant forward almost parallel to their snout.

Farmers use local and traditional breeding methods to produce landrace breeds.

Though, they have developed the American landrace pig from Norwegian and Swedish breeding stocks.

American landrace pigs are known to produce large litters and for their ability to cross well with other breeds of pigs.<br>You will find that American landrace pigs have a high percentage of meat in the ham and loin parts of the carcass.</p><br>
