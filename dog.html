<p>German Shepherds do indeed get their name from Deutschland, because that’s where the first standard-bred Shepherds appeared. The twist? German Shepherds are actually a relatively young breed, having been fully bred in the 19th century. I’ll bet you didn’t see that coming? This breed is not as old as Germany itself. Instead, it’s a trim 200 years old. Practically a baby. </p><br><br>

	        <p>The Rottweiler might seem like a recent breed given its German heritage, but the origins of the Rottweiler go back to the Roman Empire – ancient times. The ancestors of the breed would help Roman armies by functioning as a working dog, and one of the towns that ancient Roman armies would trek through is the town of Rottweil.
As the breed developed, its role shifted from that of a working dog to become a more guard dog. Many Rottweilers were used during the Middle Ages by merchants who wanted to protect their pouches of money. These merchants would tie the pouch around a Rottweiler’s neck – for many people, it was better than using a bank account!</p><br><br>

A Pomeranian is a lively little sprite of a dog. Always willing to share their opinion, play, and entertain, Poms love attention and are very intelligent, which makes them an amazing training partner. They keep a sparkle in their eyes and are quite the smiling breed with their small, pointed noses and perky ears. Pomeranians can be protective of their people and make great guard dogs since they’re always willing to bark. Just don’t tell them they aren’t the giant dog they think they are — not like they’d believe you anyway.</p><br><br>

It’s one of their most lovable characteristics. As a breed, they’re just plain happy. They live life to the fullest as loyal, friendly dogs, eager to please. They also have big brains and love to use them. These qualities, combined with a tremendous willingness to work, make them great support animals. You’ll see Labs doing search and rescue, working as guide dogs for the blind, and a host of other amazing support roles.</p><br><br>

	        <p>Get to know one of the most beloved dog breeds of all time.                                                                                  When describing a Golden Retriever, the word “versatile” fits perfectly. Not only are they fantastic sporting dogs, but they excel in many other activities. Goldens are often used as service dogs for the blind or mobility-impaired and are ideal in search-and-rescue roles due to their toughness in the field and an excellent sense of smell. The Golden Retriever is loyal and eager to please, paired with a happy-go-lucky and playful personality. The one thing they aren’t particularly good at is guarding the home. They’re more likely to seek a pat on the head from an intruder than to chase them off.</p><br><br>

	        <p>Enjoying widespread popularity, the Boxer sports a square jaw line and impressive                                                        We’ve filled you in on the recent history of the Boxer breed. They make great pets, service dogs, and even guard dogs. But let’s go back to its past, where you’re sure to find in much more interesting.
            Developed in Germany in the 19th century, Boxers were used by butchers to control cattle and for hunting purposes (they could run and hold down wild boar and bison), as well as being one of the first breeds of dogs used as police and military dogs. Unfortunately, they were also used for dog fighting – a Boxer would stand up on its hind legs and “box” with its opponent. Boxers were later imported to America after World War I, and gained popularity in the late 1930s.</p><br><br>

	        <p>The attention-loving Box-a-Pug brings together the cheerful personality of the Pug and the playful nature of the Boxer.                                                                                                                                                               His highly protective nature toward his human pack makes him a great, non-aggressive watchdog but it also means he is prone to being yappy when he feels threatened, which doesn’t make him a great choice for apartments. It also means he will likely suffer from separation anxiety if left on his own for longer periods of time, so a home with a family member always present would be ideal..</p>
