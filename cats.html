<p>Easily one of the most recognised and popular breed of cat is the Persian. This breed actually has a very old history where they have been at the centre of civilization since they were first introduced into Europe in the 17th century. Up until the late 19th century the breeding of cats with long hair from Turkey, Afghanistan and Persia were classified as Asiatic cats and were commonly bred together. Today they have been bred to keep their very unique look which is a round head, short face, snub nose, chubby cheeks, rounded ears and big eyes.</p>
	<br>
	
	<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unique physical features</h3>
<p>*&nbsp;Round everything! Persians have round eyes, face, and body.<br>
   *&nbsp;Flat face (also called brachycephalic)<br>
   *&nbsp;Thick neck — often described as having a “linebacker” body</p>
	<br><br>
	
	<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unique personality</h3>
<p>Truly the aristocrat of the cat world, the Persian is sweet and affectionate but has a playful side too. Often you find these kittens entertaining themselves with a balled-up piece of paper, but they’ll happily engage in playtime with their people, especially if you have a cat toy they can chase.The Persian might be a bit reserved when meeting new people and might hide when there’s lots of activity in the home but will warm up if given time and space to check things out on their own terms.<br>
	
The Persian cat is the quintessential lap cat. They love affection from their people but won’t harass their guardians for attention. However, they are rather high maintenance when it comes to grooming. Because of their long coat and gentle nature, they are best suited for an indoor-only lifestyle.Even though Persians love to nap, they also keep themselves entertained by playing between sleeping sessions.</p>
	<br><br>
	
	<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Colur</h3>
<p>Although white Persians have become something of iconic media stars thanks to various advertising campaigns, the breed actually offers a considerable variety of colors, with seven divisions eligible for competition: Solids, Silver and Golden, Shaded and Smoke, Tabby, Particolor, Bicolor, and Himalayan (which have the Siamese colorpoint pattern.)</p>
	<br><br>
	
	<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Care Requirements</h3>
<p>The Persian cat has a thick, multi-layered coat. Daily brushing is recommended to keep the fur and skin healthy and to prevent matting and furballs. The Persian also tends to shed more during seasonal shedding periods and will benefit from more frequent brushing during these times. Some Persian owners prefer to have their cat bathed and groomed professionally to help with the upkeep.The flat face of the Persian requires frequent cleaning to prevent infections from developing in the skin folds and keep them comfortable.<br>
	
Brachycephalic cats are less tolerant of upper respiratory infections, in that their respiratory system is already compromised and infection/inflammation worsens it. Be very observant and proactive with keeping your cat's nostrils clear of any discharge should a respiratory infection set in.
As with all cat breeds, Persians also need regular nail trimming and teeth brushing to stay happy and healthy. Introduce your Persian kitten to these experiences at a young age, keeping the experience calm and positive.</p>

<p>The Maine Coon is a native New England breed that hailed from Maine. They were a very popular farm cat, mouser and most likely a ship cat up until the early 19th century. This breed is very good natured and adapts well too many different lifestyles and personalities. They like people being around them but they aren’t necessarily clingy. The mouser trait has still been passed down for many generations so expect your home to be rodent free.</p>
	<br><br>
	
	<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall Description</h3>
<p>Maine Coons are big cats, with some males weighing as much as 25 lbs. Their large size is definitely their most distinct trait! They have muscular, rectangular bodies with broad chests. Slow to mature, individuals do not reach their full size for three to five years. Their thick coats are water resistant, with thicker growth on their ruff, stomach, and britches where they most need protection from cold and wet conditions. Their bushy tails wrap easily around their bodies to provide an additional source of warmth. These cats have large rounded feet with tufts that serve as natural snowshoes. Their eyes are big and round and can be copper, green, or gold in tone.</p><br>
	
	<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Colour</h3>
<p>The traditional coloration for this breed is a brown tabby, but the coat can actually be any shade except pointed colors or patterns. Most common solid colors are black, cream, white, and blue, and there are also variations such as tortie or part-white combinations. In fact, experts say that there are over 84 distinct colors and patterns of Maine Coon coat, meaning that any pet owner can find a specimen of this breed to suit their own liking.</p><br>
	
	<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unique Personality</h3>
	<p>Affectionate but not needy, a Maine Coon shows curiosity in what you’re doing but is also talented at entertaining themselves. With low to medium energy, this breed is content to cuddle up next to their people or practice their mousing skills with toys.Their easygoing personality makes them a great choice for families with other kittens, adult cats, dogs, or children. They are known as the gentle giants of the feline world.Maine Coon cats are relaxed and easy-going.<br>
		
	They are devoted and loyal to their humans and prefer to be where the family is, but they don’t constantly demand attention. It’s the best of both worlds. They can be independent and sociable at the same time.Maine Coons will happily follow their guardians around the home and sit next to them on the couch while binge-watching Animal Planet. While they’re only moderately active at best, they are very athletic and maintain a kitten-like enthusiasm for play and antics well into their older years.</p><br><br>

	<p>Ragdolls are very smart and with enough positive reinforcement can quickly pick up tricks and good habits such as scratching posts. This particular breed is fairly new compared to the other breeds as it was first developed by a breeder in the 1960s. They love people and like what their name suggests they simply collapse in your arms when you pick them up. Even if they are cradled on their back, they love a good cuddle and scratch from anyone. They generally stay on the same level as people rather than being at the highest point in the room.</p>
	<br><br>
      
	<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall Description</h3>
<p>Ragdolls are one of the biggest of all domestic cats. They are sturdy, with large frames and well proportioned legs. In addition to the distinctive point coloration, they always have blue eyes. For show cats, the more intense the eye color the better. Interestingly, they shed less than might be suspected because they do not have a thick undercoat. Most of their long hair is encompassed by long, outer guard hairs. Mitted Ragdolls with white feet and white chins were first allowed in the 2008-2009 show season. They are often confused with Birmans, but the latter have colored chins. When weight is considered, Ragdolls can grow up to weigh from between 12 to 20 pounds (5.4 to 9.1 kg) for males, and between 8 and 15 pounds (3.6 to 6.8 kg) for females. This makes them quite the robust breed, and that might require a little bit of extra attention when diet is considered. Now, even though these cats can have a hefty appetite, they are still quite energetic and sprightly – those calories will be quickly burned and turned into fuel for their athletic build.</p><br>
	
	<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Colour</h3>
<p>There are six accepted colors for Ragdolls: seal, chocolate, flame, blue, lilac, and cream. Every Ragdoll kitten is born white, and begin to exhibit their coat color within 8-10 weeks. Full coloration is not finalized until 2-4 years. The four accepted patterns are Pointed, Mitted, Bicolor, and Lynx. Either way, these colors are one of the biggest aspects of a Ragdoll’s unmistakable charm and beauty. Smooth and soft tones and color combinations are a true eye pleaser – the elegance and grace of a Ragdoll is a truly feline charisma that is hard to pass by.</p><br>
	
	<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Personality</h3>
<p>The Ragdoll cat is a charming and sweet breed that loves to spend time with you and will follow you anywhere you let them — including into the shower! Playful, yet calm and quiet, these cats make excellent cuddling companions, famous for going limp (just like, you guessed it, a rag doll!) when held.Ragdoll cats are highly adaptable and easy-going, which makes them great for an indoor-only lifestyle. They’re ideal for urban homes with no access to outdoor spaces, including apartments.Ragdolls are laid-back and tolerant, which enables them to get along well with other cats and kittens, animals, and young children. They aren’t excessively demanding of attention but love their human companions, so even busy families can enjoy these kitties.</p><br><br><br>

	<p>The Siamese cat is the pinnacle of sophistication as they look like they are all dressed up for a masquerade ball. If you live in an apartment or house that doesn’t allow for pets good luck trying to hide a Siamese as they are very talkative and opinionated. While they are extremely fond of people, they will definitely tell you what they are thinking in a very loud and raspy tone and expect you to wait on them when the call. They do require attention and play time so if you are on the go all the time this may not be the right breed for you.</p>
	<br><br>
	
	<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall Description</h3>
<p>The Siamese is a sleek lined, small to medium sized cat with aristocratic and well-defined features. Their almond-shaped eyes are a deep blue, and beautifully contrasting colors mark the “points” of their silky, short coats. Their heads are wedge-shaped and long, topping tubular, muscular bodies supported by fine, graceful legs. Both the tail and neck are elegant, creating the breed’s overall pleasingly linear profile. The profile is totally straight, and the chin especially well aligned. Large, thin ears complete the wedge shape of the head. Once known for both kinked tails and crossed eyes, those traits were seen as a fault, and have been largely eliminated through careful selective breeding.</p><br>
	
	<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Colour</h3>
<p>The best recognized of the Siamese colors is the Seal Point, with its pale fawn body and striking black extremities. In 1934 the blue point gained CFA recognition, followed by the lilac point in 1955. There is also a chocolate point, although that variation appears less frequently. Currently, however, color pointing in the Siamese can be found in the following shades: Seal, Chocolate, Blue, Lilac, Cinnamon, Fawn, Red, Cream, Apricot, and Carmel. The points can additionally be patterned with Tabby or Tortie patterning.</p><br>
	
	<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Grooming Requirements</h3>
<p>The tight, glossy coat is short and fine, adhering close to the body and requiring little in the way of special care. Unlike long-haired cat breeds, the Siamese won’t require hours and hours of meticulous brushing and untangling of the hair knots and mats. Many owners find that nothing more is required than a good rub down with a chamois cloth to remove loose hairs from the coat, a process the convivial Siamese enjoys enormously. Still, every cat should be brushed a few times a week to minimize shedding and to maintain a healthy coat, so don’t skimp on the beauty routine even if your kitty’s coat is amongst those considered low maintenance.<br>
	
In addition to caring for the coat, you should also make sure that the grooming of your precious pet includes oral care and neat nails. The nails should be regularly trimmed or filed down, not just to protect your furniture and legs of unsuspecting passersby, but to prevent potentially painful conditions such as torn or broken nails. Similarly, your cat’s teeth should be regularly cleaned- even though they’ll most likely protest. Brush their teeth with special cat-friendly toothpaste and toothbrush at least once or twice a week and take your pet to regular vet check-ups to make sure that any plaque buildup is dealt with in time before it causes teeth loss and other issues.</p><br><br><br>

	<p>The British shorthair is iconic in pop culture being the breed that was featured as puss in boots from Shrek and the Cheshire Cat of Alice in Wonderland. It is obliviously an English breed and has been the pinnacle of the pedigree since the Victorian era. They are very mellow and easy going making them a wonderful addition to any family. They love some affection but doesn’t whinge non-stop when you don’t give them love for 2 seconds.</p>
	
	  <br>
   
	<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall Description</h3>
<p>Often described as having a “teddy bear” appearance, the British Shorthair is a sturdy cat with a large head and big, round, inquisitive eyes. The breed is slow to mature, not reaching full size until at least three years of age. They are big cats, with males reaching as much as 17 pounds. Powerful and well balanced, the Shorthair is broad of chest and short of leg with rounded paws and a tail that narrows to a rounded tip from a thick base. Small ears top a sizeable head made to appear even wider thanks to the cat’s full cheeks.</p><br>
	
	<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Colour</h5>
<p>The British Shorthair comes in many patterns and colors. The blue variant has been widely popular, but in recent years the black, white, red, cream, chocolate, lilac, and cinnamon variations have grown in prevalence. The cats can be all one color, or they can be colorpoints, tabbies, and bicolors</p><br>
	
	<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Grooming Requirements</h3>
<p>The coat of the British Shorthair can be compared to a carpet with a deep pile. They have more hairs per square inch in their coats than any other breed. Surprisingly, this luxurious coat requires very little care beyond brushing or combing with a wire toothed comb to remove dead and loose hairs. This should be done on a weekly basis to minimize shedding.</p><br><br>

	<p>The exotic shorthair is similar to the Persian breed but with a different coat. They were first bred in the 1950s by cross breeding Persians with American shorthairs. They were then bred with Burmese and Russian Blue breeds before going back to Persian once they had a short coat. The result was a breed with the same features and personality of the Persian but with an easy to care for coat. Due to their pedigree breeding they do come with a lot of health concerns relating to their face.</p>
	<br>

	<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall Description</h3>
<p>The Exotic Shorthair is an unusually robust cat with short legs and a cobby build. It is a heavily boned animal, whose body is well proportioned and balanced. The Exotic should be round when viewed from virtually any angle, with heads that are the size and shape of a softball. Their eyes are also rounded with a sweet, inquisitive expression. The eyes are docile, but intelligent and engaged. The short snub nose is clearly inherited from this cat’s Persian antecedents, and, like a Persian, they are prone to eye staining. An Exotic Shorthair’s tail is typically of the “bottlebrush” variety and is not especially long. Often referred to as “Teddy bears,” the Exotic Shorthair is a soft, hefty, well-contoured cat that invites — and welcomes — cuddling.</p><br>
	
	<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Colour</h3>
<p>The Exotic Shorthair is found in all color and pattern combinations. Favored shades include blue, black, cream, red, tortoiseshell, and tabby.</p><br>
	
	<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Grooming Requirements</h3>
<p>Unlike all other short-haired cats, the Exotic Shorthair’s coat is even all over, with no ruff or feathering at the tail. The dense fur has a medium soft texture. Grooming can be easily accomplished with a steel comb to prevent matting and tangling. No more than one or two sessions a week is necessary. Exotics do need the occasional bath, especially when they are shedding their winter coat. Fortunately, these cats take well to bathing and are easily handled. Care should be taken to keep the eyes clean to avoid staining in the corners.</p><br><br><br>

	<p>While most cats love to sleep and laze around, the Abyssinian lives life to the max. They climb higher, jump further and play harder than their other brethren. They are a very intelligent breed which makes them both an entertaining and challenging pet to have. Abby Grabby is the nickname given to this breed as they are known for taking anything that grabs their attention. If you do plan on getting an Aby be sure to have a tonne of toys on hand as they love to play!</p><br>
	<br>
	
	<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall Description</h3>
<p>Abyssinians are medium-sized cats with an alert, engaged appearance emphasized by their tall, pointy ears. Almond eyes in varying shades of copper, gold, green, and hazel highlight the broad, wedge-shaped head, and give the Aby its inquisitive expression. The small, oval paws and slender, long legs create a fine-boned look, but the breed is muscular and well-proportioned. The long tail is broad at the base but narrows to a point. Aby’s have medium length fur that is dense, but silky in texture further enhancing the cat’s overall sleekness.</p><br>
	
		<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Colour</h3>
<p>Each hair of an Aby’s coat progresses from a lighter base color to a black tip across three or four darker bands. This distinctive “ticking” pattern is only found in two other breeds, the Somali and the Singapura. The Aby’s original reddish-brown base color with black ticking is called “Usual” in Great Britain and “Ruddy” in the United States. In this variation, the cat’s feet, including the backside of the hind legs, are black. Other colorations include the yellow-brown or cinnamon “Sorrell,” the light beige “Blue,” and the rare “Fawn,” with a light cream tone base. “Silver” Abys are not recognized by the Cat Fancier’s Association. Their undercoat is pure white. The “Chocolate” (a darker version of the Sorrel) and “Lilac” (a variation of the Blue) are now recognized for champion status in the United Kingdom.</p><br>
	
		<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Grooming Requirements</h3>
<p>The Abyssinian requires little in the way of grooming thanks to its dense and manageable coat. An occasional bath to remove loose hair, in tandem with a regular regimen of brushing will keep the Abys coat sleek and shiny. The breed is somewhat prone to develop gingivitis, so kittens should be taught to tolerate having their teeth brushed, or they should be provided with dental treats to help reduce tartar buildup.</p>
