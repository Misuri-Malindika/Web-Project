	<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall Description</h4>
	<p>Alaska Rabbits have balanced and well-rounded bodies, and even though they are not compact like other breeds, they do feature good bone development. They are often described as thickset, solid, and blocky. Males will be a bit heavier, while females will have features that are more feminine, and females will also showcase a dewlap.<br>
	
The ears of the Alaska Rabbit should be short when compared to similar breeds. They will also be broad, rounded at the ends, and help upright.<br><br>
	<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Coat</h5>
	The Alaska Rabbit’s short coat is one of its most distinguishing features because it is luxurious, soft, and dense.<br><br>
	<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Colours</h5>
	An Alaska Rabbit will be solid colored, and the only color that these rabbits feature is black. If you look at the fur that is nearest to the skin, it will typically be deep slate blue in color, but it will turn into a jet black color towards the surface of the fur.<br>
	
The pads of the rabbit’s feet, as well as the belly and nose, will often feature a matte black hue, while the sides and the top of this rabbit are colored vibrantly. Overall, the fur is considered lustrous and silky, and there is an obvious glossy sheen.
	
These rabbits also feature dark brown eyes and dark toenails. There might also be just a few white hairs scattered throughout the fur, but there shouldn’t be a high number of stray white hairs, white patches, or white spots.
An Alaska Rabbit will be solid black.<br><br>
	
	<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Care Requirements</h5>
	You can keep your Alaska Rabbit indoors or outside, but just be sure to provide him with a secure area where he will be able to get some sunshine while feeling safe. Even though your pet should have a place to sunbathe, he also needs a shaded spot to retreat to whenever he wants to. An outdoor hutch should be weatherproof and waterproof, and you can use sawdust as a substrate that can be cleaned easily.


If you are going to be keeping your rabbit indoors with other pets, introduce the animals to one another carefully, preferably while they are young. You should provide your rabbit with a place to rest undisturbed, such as a dog crate, and you should rabbit-proof your home so that he will not chew on anything that could be dangerous or important to you while he is outside of his cage.


Your Alaska Rabbit’s diet can consist of high quality pellets for rabbits, along with various hays and plenty of greens and vegetables. This will ensure he gets the nutrition he needs without gaining too much weight.

<p>The American Fuzzy Lop is sweet, energetic rabbit that is known to be great for show, fur and pet purposes. Their wooly coat is great to be shown off to the world and the American Fuzzy Lop is a favorite in competitions. For practical purposes, this rabbit’s fur can be spun and made into different kinds of clothes. Their curious, playful attitude makes them great pets for singles, seniors and families alike so long as they are given plenty of love, affection and a place to let their energy run free (a fenced yard would be more than sufficient).
	The American Fuzzy Lop has a short, thick body. They have a broad chest, short shoulders and broad, deep, well-rounded hindquarters with plenty of muscles. Their fuzzy ears flop to the sides of their heads.</p>

<br><br>
		<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Coat</h5>
<p>The American Fuzzy Lop’s coat is actually wool, as it can be spun into yarn despite being only about 2 inches in length. These rabbits are also known as “The Head of Fancy,” which lets you know how lovely their wool really is. American Fuzzy Lop wool is coarse, like that of an Angora rabbit – this means the coat will not be prone to tangling or matting. American Fuzzy Lops can be prone to matting around the tail area, mostly from sitting. Part of your grooming process should include trimming nails, brushing, and trimming the mats.</p>	
	<br><br>
	    <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Colour</h5>
<p>The American Fuzzy Lop rabbit can come in a variety of different colors such as Agouti, which is a combination of any color with white (colors include Chestnut, Chinchilla, Lynx, Opal and Squirrel) and the Pointed White Group, which is a pure white body. However, all American Fuzzy Lops have distinctive markings on their nose, have eye circles and tinted ears.

	<br><br>
	     <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Care Requirements</h5>
<p>Rabbits are clean animals when it comes to grooming themselves, and American Fuzzy Lops are no exception. These rabbits do not require daily grooming unless they are going through a molt. When this happens, simply run your fingers through their wool to work out any tangles and debris that may have gotten stuck in their coat.

You may also use a pet-specific brush if you don’t want to use your fingers, but under no circumstances should you fully bathe your rabbit; this causes them far too much stress. If you find a stain on your Fuzzy Lop’s coat, you can “spot clean” it with a damp cloth.<br>

As with all other rabbits, their diet should consist of 70-80 percent hay and grass with the rest of their meal consisting of fresh fruits and vegetables. Make sure your rabbit’s enclosure is dung-free, clean, and always has fresh water at their disposal.

If your rabbit’s enclosure is outdoors, always be wary of the temperatures and weather forecast, as these factors can be a potential danger to your furry animal. Whether your enclosure is indoors or out, it’s best to keep this little guy happy with plenty of free time outside their cage. <br>
American Fuzzy Lops are active rabbits who love to run and jump round while basking in the sunlight, so a fenced backyard is recommended. If you live in an area where winters are particularly harsh and your Fuzzy Lop is indoors, they will still benefit from having time outside of their enclosures playing with their toys and cozying up with their favorite human.</p><br><br><br>

<p>The New Zealand has a rather well-rounded commercial body shape, which is slender yet muscular. In many ways, they have that iconic, unmistakable classic bunny look that is balanced and has great appeal to potential owners. This breed was primarily developed for the production of meat and their appearance shows it. From hips to loins to ribs, the New Zealand rabbit is a well-filled animal. Their head is moderately rounded, and in proportion with the rest of their body. Ears are thick, well-furred with rounded tips and carried erect. Does are bigger than bucks with a maximum weight of 10 to 12 pounds, where the male of the breed is supposed to weigh between 9 and 11 pounds. While the difference is not too great, you can still certainly tell which is the male and which is the female New Zealand Rabbit.</p>

While the difference is not too great, you can still certainly tell which is the male and which is the female New Zealand Rabbit. </p><br>
	
	<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cout</h5>
<p>New Zealand rabbits have short, soft flyback fur that is set tightly in the pelt. Their coat does not need much grooming (as rabbits are generally clean animals), however, should you keep your New Zealand as a pet, you may find grooming them from time to time will reduce the amount of loose hair in your home. To boot, this will make sure your pet doesn’t ingest a lot of their own hair during self-grooming which can be dangerous for their health.

Grooming them once every week or biweekly with a bristled brush should do the trick. Always remember that rabbits should not be bathed, as this causes them great stress and may cause cardiac problems. Instead, if you do notice a bit of dirt on the paws or the rump, you should use a wet cotton ball for some gentle cleaning. It can do wonders for cleanliness and those pristine looks. No need to put your pet through stress or potentially cause them harm to keep them clean and hygienic!</p><br>
	
	<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Colour</h5>
<p>The New Zealand rabbit has five colors that are recognized by the ARBA. These are red, white, black, blue, and broken, the latter being any color mixed with white. Each of the coat colors belongs to a separate variety of the breed. The New Zealand rabbit is quite the charmer! They are amongst the prettiest of all common rabbit breeds, and are definitely prized for their looks. This is great for potential owners who are picky about the colors of their rabbit. These looks are certain to satisfy most tastes, so no worries there. <br>

Of course, if you want to maintain the elegance of their coat regardless of its color, you should adopt a steady grooming routine. Regular light brushing will be ideal to keep everything in order, and to get rid of any loose hairs, mats, and tufts. Just keep in mind that bunnies shouldn't really be washed.New Zealand rabbits enjoy being handled and are rather easy-going.</p><br>
	
		<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Care Requirements</h5>
<p>Like all rabbits, New Zealands need an adequate enclosure to eat, sleep, etc. Outdoor enclosures should be raised and have enough space for the rabbit to stretch their legs comfortably, hop about and sit up. Considering this rabbit’s size, their habitat needs to be rather large. As a rule of thumb, any New Zealand Rabbit will need an enclosure that’s 30” by 36”. Indoor rabbit enclosures should be made of sturdy wire all around, have a plastic or metal bottom and be large enough for the New Zealand rabbit to stretch out, just like outdoor enclosures. The bottom of their cages should be covered in rabbit-safe bedding, and it needs to be spot-cleaned every day and completely replaced at the end of every week. Hay, wood pellets, shredded paper, and sawdust are some of the most common choices for rabbit cage bedding.<br>

In addition to spending time inside their spacious and comfortable enclosure, rabbits will also need to be let out to play on a regular basis. However, before you let your pet out, you need to bunny-proof the space they are going to be in. Indoors, remove any toxic house plants or foods your rabbit could get to, hide electric cables and protect wooden furniture legs your bunny will try to gnaw at. Outside, make them a pen that will keep them in a safe area, away from predators and without means to wander off. In both cases, you will have to supervise your bunny.<br>

A New Zealand rabbit’s diet is no different than any other rabbit diet in that it should consist mainly of high quality hay. Most rabbit owners agree that timothy hay is the best bang for your buck, but orchard hay is also acceptable and the occasional alfalfa grass is also beneficial. The rest of the diet should be a good balance of fruits, leafy greens, vegetables, and pellets. Like hay, there are plenty of types of pellets available on the market, some with higher protein content than others. Of course, if you are ever uncertain of the type of diet you should offer your pet, don’t hesitate to contact your veterinarian. After a thorough checkup, they can get acquainted with your rabbit’s needs and prescribe the ideal diet that will keep them as healthy as ever. <br>

Be aware of what kind of fruits, leafy greens, and vegetables you have in your home as some are rabbit-safe and others are not. In fact, most leafy greens are unsafe as they can cause digestive issues, especially if you feed your rabbit a large amount of it. Feed your rabbit greens that are high in fiber and nutrients, such as romaine lettuce, and be aware of what kind of fruits you’re feeding (apples are a wonderful choice). Don’t hesitate to get acquainted with the best greens for rabbits – so you should not feed them something that’s not good for them. </p><br><br><br>

Rabbits aren’t always the most social pets, so that makes this breed particularly attractive for bunny lovers who like to get up close and personal with their pets. They love receiving attention from their humans, which makes them ideal rabbits for homes with children (who are often disappointed by the antisocial nature of many rabbits).</p><br>
	
	<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cout</h5>
<p>Now onwards to the pride of every bunny – the coat! The Rex Rabbit has a unique gene which gives its coat a velvety texture. The coat is extremely dense, and the hair’s length and quality uniform all across the body. Hairs are short but not shorter than half an inch- or longer than ⅞ of an inch. This short, soft fur that points out instead of against their bodies like most rabbits makes this breed feel super plushy. Unfortunately, their smooth and dense fur made them interesting to the fur industry. Many horrible owners often kept this breed around for their pelts alone. Thankfully, we are long past that unfortunate chapter in Rex Rabbit's history. They are now owned only by those who love them as living beings regardless of how pretty their fur might be.<br>
Now, when the Rex Rabbit is a popular pet, their unique coat is considered to be just one of their many charming qualities and not a source of profit. Despite its one-of-a-kind coat, though, this breed is not high maintenance when it comes to grooming. In fact, it requires even less grooming than other rabbit varieties. Owners should try to groom this rabbit as little as possible, as over-grooming can damage its coats. If there’s excess dirt on your rabbit’s coat, simply clean it with a damp cloth. Never bathe your bunny, as this causes great stress and can cause cardiac problems and even result in death. As much as you might enjoy bunny bath time, it’s simply not a good idea for your pet. Fortunately there are plenty of easy alternatives.	</p><br>
	
	<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Colour</h5>
<p>After the coat, the colors are next in importance. After all, without a striking color, the coat of the velvety Rex won’t appear as majestic as it should. In the United States, there are 16 accepted coat colors for the Rex Rabbit breed. Some of these include castor, seal, chinchilla, opal, black, white, Californian, amber, as well as Broken (which is any color mixed with white). In other words there is a Rex Rabbit out there to suit any personal pet preference. Some of these colors are more desired than the others, so you’ll always find colors that are much more established on the market. </p><br>
	
	<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Care Requirements</h5>
<p>To make sure your bunny stays healthy and happy under your roof, you will need to provide proper rabbit housing. The two main aspects to consider are the size and the type of materials. Enclosures need to be large enough for your rabbit to comfortably stretch out in, have enough room to play, do its business and eat. This translates to at least 12 feet of cage space (6 x 2 feet), coupled with a minimum of 32 square feet of bunny-safe playing space, which is usually fenced by a pen or a playpen gate.As for the bunny-safe materials of the enclosures, choose indoor cages made of strong wire that have a solid bottom. Wire bottom at the cage is a big no-no, as it will hurt your bunny and lead to sore hocks. The enclosure needs to be lined with bedding, spot-cleaned every day and completely replaced at the end of every week.<br>
Rabbits have extremely strong teeth and a tendency to chew everything, which often leads to catastrophe. Not only that your furniture or shoes could be ruined, but your bunny could die after nibbling on electric wires or eating a dangerous houseplant. So, to avoid any potential problems, ensure that the space is safe for your pet (and your valuables protected) before you let your bunny roam free. In case you have a garden or a backyard where your Rex Rabbit can play, make sure to let them out only in a well-secured pen and with you supervising them.
In terms of their ideal diet, the Rex Rabbit is no different than most other bunny breeds. Remember that the diet is the cornerstone of every pet’s health. This is especially true for bunnies. They should be fed only the best bunny foods, and you should never experiment with foods not suited to them. Your pet can end up in big trouble if you give them something they shouldn’t eat!<br>
They require a diet that consists of 70 percent high-quality hay (such as orchard hay) with the rest being a good mix of leafy greens, fruits, pellets and vegetables. Hay such as alfalfa should only be given in moderation and fruits/vegetables which contain high levels of sugar should be used mostly as treats. Always research what kind of food you are giving to your rabbit, as there are some that are safe and others that can make them sick. Additionally, you should ensure your rabbit always has access to fresh and clean water.</p><br><br>

	<p>The Himalayan breed is the only kind of rabbit known to have a cylindrical body shape. When looking at this rabbit from an aerial point of view, the sides should be straight from its shoulders to the hind legs with little or no taper. Even when these rabbits are stretched out as far as they can, their feet will remain flat on the surface, which makes them truly unique.</p><br>

<p>The Himalayan breed is the only kind of rabbit known to have a cylindrical body shape. When looking at this rabbit from an aerial point of view, the sides should be straight from its shoulders to the hind legs with little or no taper. Even when these rabbits are stretched out as far as they can, their feet will remain flat on the surface, which makes them truly unique.</p><br>
	
	<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cout</h5>
<p>A Himalayan rabbit’s flyback fur is short, soft and doesn’t need much maintenance in order to keep its healthy sheen. Should you find your Himalayan rabbit is shedding more than usual (such as during spring), simply brush their fur 2-3 times per week or as required. Otherwise, a weekly brushing with spot-cleaning using a damp cloth should more than sufficient.</p><br>
	
	<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Colour</h5>
<p>The Himalayan rabbit’s body is always white with different colored markings. The markings include colored “boots”, an egg-shaped marking on its nose and a colored tail and ears. The markings can be black, blue, chocolate or lilac. This coloration is due to a heat-sensitive enzyme on the Himalayan’s body that creates a brown pigment melanin. This enzyme is active on the parts of the body where the Himalayan rabbit is discolored, such as their ears, nose, feet and tail.Anything from a rabbit-safe block of wood to a pet-store purchased toy should do fine to ease the Himalayan rabbit’s boredom.</p><br>
	
	<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Care Requirements</h5>
<p>Himalayan kits (which is short for kittens, also known as baby rabbits) are particularly sensitive to cold, so be sure to bring them indoors if the weather is a little on the chilly side. Should older Himalayan rabbits be exposed to cold temperatures, their white fur could darken, but otherwise, they should do well so long as the temperature does not drop below the freezing mark. Outdoor enclosures should be made of wire or wood and should be raised in order to protect your rabbit from the elements and predators such as coyotes and raccoons.<br>
Indoor enclosures should be made of wire with a plastic bottom so bedding can be placed for comfort. Bedding should be spot-cleaned every day to rid of it feces, and completely changed every week. Some pet parents opt for buying a completely wire cage, however this is uncomfortable for your rabbit’s feet and can cause issues in the long run. Make sure their enclosure is large enough so they can comfortably stretch out of their full size and although Himalayans are relatively small, they are long so make sure you purchase the correct enclosure size.Like other rabbits, the Himalayan will benefit from a diet that consists 70 percent of high-quality hay and the rest of a healthy mix of fruits, vegetables, leafy greens and pellets. There are plenty types of pellets and hay available on the market, some with higher protein content than the other depending on your budget. <br>
Be aware of what kid of fruits, leafy greens and vegetables you have in your home as some are rabbit-safe and others are not. In fact, most leafy greens are unsafe as they can cause digestive issues, especially if you feed your rabbit a large amount of it. Feed your rabbit greens that are high in fiber and nutrients, such as romaine lettuce, and be aware of what kind of fruits you’re feeding (nothing that is too high in sugar).</p><br><br><br>

<p>You might not find the words “fuzzy basketball with a head” in the ARBA Standard of Perfection for the Mini Lop, but it really does sum up how an ideal representative of what this breed should look like. The Mini Lop has a compact body type and is among the smaller rabbit breeds. An adult Mini Lop should weigh anywhere from 3 to 6 pounds, with the does being smaller than bucks. Regardless of their ultimate size, they all share a signature rounded body type: little furry balls of joy. Their legs are short and stocky, as well as their tails, which also contributes to their fluffy ball look, and of course, only makes them more irresistible for potential owners.

	<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall Description</h5>
<p>You might not find the words “fuzzy basketball with a head” in the ARBA Standard of Perfection for the Mini Lop, but it really does sum up how an ideal representative of what this breed should look like. The Mini Lop has a compact body type and is among the smaller rabbit breeds. An adult Mini Lop should weigh anywhere from 3 to 6 pounds, with the does being smaller than bucks. Regardless of their ultimate size, they all share a signature rounded body type: little furry balls of joy. Their legs are short and stocky, as well as their tails, which also contributes to their fluffy ball look, and of course, only makes them more irresistible for potential owners.<br>
	
When it comes to the official standard for showing Mini Lops, an overall rounded appearance is not enough to describe them – the criteria are much more precise in the world of show bunnies. According to the standard, their body should be massive and thickest, despite its relatively small size. It is heavily-muscled and well-rounded, and dewlap is permitted for the females of the species. The neck should be as short as possible, with the broad head sitting close to their compact bodies (often it appears like they don’t have a neck at all). As the name of the breed suggests, the rounded and well-furred ears sit lopping vertically to the sides of the head. </p><br>
	
	<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cout</h5>
<p>Mini Lops have a luxurious soft, medium-length rollback coat. However, despite their gorgeous fur, they do not require much care in the grooming department. Especially when compared to wooly breeds such as the English Angora, which is one of the breeds considered to be high maintenance because of its thick luscious mane. Weekly brushing is all that’s necessary to keep their coat soft, plush, and tangle free. This will also help remove dead hair and reduce shedding, which is great both because it means that there’ll be less bunny hair around your furniture and floors, but also because it will reduce the possibility of your rabbit ingesting his hair and experiencing blockage. Some owners may wish to increase the amount of grooming to twice a week during molting periods, which usually occur twice a year. That could be a wise choice just to be safe.<br>
	
If your Mini Lop is a proud show rabbit, you need to remember that their coat needs to meet certain standards that are expected for the breed. The ideal Mini Lop coat should be quite thick and dense, sporting that iconic sheen, overall looking glossy and lustrous. It also has to be medium in length with a good roll back. Coat that is extremely short, too long, thin, silky, or harsh, is seen as a fault on shows.</p><br>
	
	<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Colour</h5>
<p>The ARBA accepts a range of colors and markings for the Mini Lop. There are seven different color groups that are common with this breed: agouti, broken, pointed white, self, shaded, ticked, and wide band. These categorizations might not mean much if you’re new to the world of rabbits, but they do make it clear that there’s a pattern or a shade of the Mini Lop to match anyone’s preference. Some of the most common colors spotted in Mini Lops are – amongst others – Chocolate, Ruby-eyed white, Opal, Lynx, White, Black, Chestnut Agouti, Chinchilla, Blue-eyed white, Lilac, Orange, Blue, and Tri Color. Such variation is not often spotted in the world of pet rabbits, and allows for plenty of diversity in shows as well as for people that are picking out a pet.<br>
	
Whether you want a tri-colored, solid black, or anything in between, you’ll be able to find it! Yet another reason why the Mini Lop has become such a beloved option for rabbit owners. They aren’t just adorable, they are practically customizable.Mini Lops should be out of their enclosures to play and create a lasting bond with their human handlers.</p><br>
	
	<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Care Requirements</h5>
<p>Like all rabbits, Mini Lops need an adequate enclosure to live their lives, eat, sleep, etc. As most rabbits, Mini Lops can live either inside the house or outside, provided that all of their needs are met and that their housing is adequate. This means, in terms of outdoor enclosures, that their hutch should be placed somewhere away from the harsh elements, such as strong winds, biting cold, or scorching sun in the summer months. Rabbits are very sensitive to extreme weather conditions, so if you keep them outside, you need to be prepared to find a perfect location – sometimes, as a compromise, people place their bunny’s hutch in the garage or similar places when they are not able to keep them inside the house. Their outdoor hutch should be raised and have enough space for the rabbit to stretch their legs out comfortably. It should also have a ramp that lowers to the bottom of their fenced enclosure so they can feel some grass and ground beneath their feet. The bottom should be cushioned with bedding if it’s made from wire – never leave rabbits on wire cage bottoms because of the possibility for sore hocks – and cleaned regularly. Of course, their hutch should also have their food, water, and toys inside.<br>
	
On the other hand, indoor rabbits should have a wire enclosure that also allows them enough space to stretch out and of course, a corner to do their business. Their bedding should be spot-cleaned every day so they can lay down on clean and soft bedding. It should be completely replenished every week. Health issues can arise surprisingly quickly if rabbit owners don’t pay careful attention to the cleanliness of their rabbits home. It is a responsibility that needs to be taken quite seriously. Needless to say, though, a rabbit shouldn’t be kept inside their enclosure exclusively – they need to be able to freely roam around and explore outside their cage. When you keep your pet indoors, that means you will also have to rabbit proof the area they will have access to, both for their safety and to protect your furniture, cables, etc. from damage.</p><br><br><br>

<p>A medium-sized breed, Swiss Fox Rabbit has a compact body type and weighs between 5.5 and 7.5 lbs. They are well-muscled, with short necks, and slightly upright posture. Their ears are strong, carried upright and long, usually around 4 inches. Although they originate from Angora, Swiss Fox rabbits have no facial furnishings, and the hair on their head and ears is shorter than on the rest of their bodies, creating an attractive contrast.</p><br>
	
	<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Coat</h5>
<p>Even though it’s not fox-like, the fur of Swiss Fox Rabbit is beautiful in its own right. They have long hair of normal type, and their coat is very soft and easy to groom. Their glossy, silky fur is dense, with an undercoat and plenty of awn hair. During the molting season, they should be regularly brushed to help the shedding process and minimize the amount of hair that ends up in your rabbit’s digestive tract.</p><br>
	
	<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Colour</h5>
<p>Inspired by the bluish hue of an Arctic fox’s seasonal coat, the breeders first created a Swiss Fox Rabbit with a blue coat. Now, the accepted coat colors include white (with red or blue irises), black, Havana, and Chinchilla. Like all long-haired rabbits, Swiss Foxes have diluted colors, which are more pastel than vibrant. When it comes to patterns, this breed can have self (mono-colored) and agouti (chinchilla) specimens.
Even though they have long, fine hair, their coat is very low-maintenance.</p><br>
	
	<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Care Requirements</h5>
<p>Originally bred for commercial purpose (fur), this rabbit breed is now kept mostly as a pet. They could adapt to living in an outdoor hutch, provided that their needs are met, but would fare better if kept indoors.Swiss Fox Rabbits need a spacious enclosure or cage to spend their time in, so make sure to choose one that fits their size. The enclosure should leave enough room for your bunny to comfortably hop around, sit up straight and stretch. You should also make sure to use a rabbit-friendly bedding for the cage, such as wood shavings or straw, and clean it as soon as soiled. <br>
	
The bedding should be replaced entirely once a week.Not unlike all rabbits, this long-haired breed thrives on a diet that is rich in fibers and roughage. Veggies, some fruits, and rabbit pellets will provide your bunny with important nutrients, but quality hay is an essential part of their diet. Roughage such as meadow hay or alfalfa hay is not only healthy for rabbits, it keeps their teeth in check and helps their digestion.Social and friendly, Swiss Fox Rabbits will need quality playtime to be happy. If you are letting your bunny play outside, always make sure they are supervised, and in a safe, enclosed space, to prevent them from wandering away or being attacked by predators. When it comes to indoor fun, get some rabbit toys for their cage and let them out to play and exercise in a rabbit-proofed room.</p><br><br><br>
